Step 1: Create a user defined exception class named “InvalidCountryException”. Step 2: Overload the respective constructors. Step 3: Create a main class “UserRegistration”, add the following method, registerUser– The parameter are String username,String userCountry and add the following logic, • if userCountry is not equal to “India” throw a InvalidCountryException with the message “User Outside India cannot be registered” • if userCountry is equal to “India”, print the message “User registration done successfully” Invoke the method registerUser from the main method with the data specified and see how the program behaves.\n",
