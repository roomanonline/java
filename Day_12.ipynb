    "This is one of the most simple array problems you will see, mostly asked in a technical round of Interview. You have given an integer array which contains numbers from 1 to 100 but one number is missing, you need to write a Java program to find that missing number in an array. You cannot use any open source library or Java API methods(built-in methods) which solves this problem. \n",
